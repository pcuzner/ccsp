This package provides a capacity utilisation monitor for the Red Hat Storage portfolio. It is intended to be installed on a node within a ceph or glusterfs cluster, and enabled as a service or systemd unit. The tool gathers cluster capacity
metrics and stores them in an rrd database. The rrd data is then used to generate graphs to show cluster utilisation over a given timeframe.
